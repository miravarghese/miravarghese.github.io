            <p>At the University of Maryland, soccer is one of the most popular sports amongst the student body. Throughout the fall semester, students flock to Ludwig Field to cheer on the Terrapins. There is even an entire student group, the UMD Crew, dedicated to supporting the soccer team, hosting tailgates, gathering in the stands and even mocking opponents to cheer on Maryland.</p>
            <p>However, the Crew mostly supports the men’s team, just one example of how support for the men’s and women’s soccer teams is not equal at the university. The inequality in popularity for each team is further evidenced by the fact that men’s soccer home games have remarkably higher attendance than the women’s team.</p>

            <p>Despite key commonalities, such as shared opponents and even the location of games, the men’s and women’s soccer games at the university spur different reactions from the campus community.<p>
            <p>Catherine DeRosa, a midfielder on the women’s team and a sophomore communications major, said that the contrast between how many people attend her team’s home games versus the men’s team may be attributed to each team’s success on the field. </p>
            <p>“I think the men get more fans just based on their success and their program’s success over a ton of years and our women's program hasn't had that success yet,” DeRosa said. </p>

            <div class="offset-lg-1 col-lg-4">
                <p>The men’s team has indeed performed better than the women’s. From 2017 to 2021, the men’s soccer has won an average <span class="stat">57%</span> of its home games, whereas the women have won <span class="stat">36%</span> of their games. In the 2021 season, men’s soccer won <span class="stat">nine out of their 12</span> home games and the women won <span class="stat">three out of 10</span> home games.</p>

        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="offset-lg-4 col-lg-5">
                <p> In terms of championship titles, men’s soccer has also won more than the women’s team. In 1968, 2005, 2008 and 2018, the men’s team won the NCAA Division I Championship, something which the women’s team has not yet accomplished.</p> 
                <p>Tori Paul, a midfielder and sophomore kinesiology major, also said that the men’s history of winning has made it easier for it to amass more community support. “It is easier for people such as the Crew to create such a huge fan base,” she said.</p> 
                <p>Paul and DeRosa also noted that marketing and media coverage are also necessary to increase the community’s support for their team. DeRosa said she felt that the men’s team is generally marketed much more than the women’s and its relationship with the Crew further increases its popularity.</p> 
                <p>“The men have the Crew and they have tailgates before every game and they have benefits of being a part of the Crew... which you can't really get if you go to a women's game,” DeRosa said.</p>

                <p>While the Crew did attend some of the women’s games in the 2021 season, both players said that its attendance at more of its games would go a long way in increasing support for their team and program. Paul also said that greater media coverage would also help spread the word about when women’s games are taking place.</p> 
                <p>Joshua Bolma, a midfielder and forward on the men’s soccer team and a freshman enrolled in Letters and Sciences, said that he has personally noticed how the world of sports naturally favors men.</p>
                <p>“Male  athletes get more attention and...just everything favors them more, I think in this specific arena, compared to females,” he said. Bolma agreed with DeRosa and Paul that the men’s record has likely contributed to its popularity, but also noted that the highly competitive nature of men’s soccer may also make their games more popular.</p>

                <p>Source: The Diamondback</p>
                <p>Bolma said that there is a role for the men’s team to play in increasing support for the women’s program. One way he and his teammates may do this is by attending women’s games.</p> 
                <p>“A lot of us [are] also friends with the Crew.... if we're going to the games, or even if we're not, we could at least try to invite them and talk to them and try to get them to also go and support the women’s [team]...as well as try to go to the games,” he said.</p>
                <p>DeRosa said that the men’s and women’s team have a good relationship and that the male athletes fully support her team, which showed when they attended their games. Nonetheless, she said that improving the program’s success may be the key to increasing the women’s team’s popularity at the university.</p> 
                <p>The situation at the University of Maryland is not unique, as limited support and attention is something all female athletes may experience.</p> 
                <p>“Female athletes have always been overlooked in my opinion, so I think that's a struggle that we will forever face,” DeRosa said.</p>
