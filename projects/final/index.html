            <p>The world of sports is still male dominated, with male athletes and teams receiving significantly more attention and support than their female counterparts. This is a reality for professional athletes, but also for the women’s soccer team at the University of Maryland, who continues to see significantly less spectators at their home games than the men’s team, reflecting the stark contrast in the campus commuity’s support for each team. </p>

            <p>At the university, soccer is one of the most popular sports amongst the student body. Throughout the fall semester, students flock to Ludwig Field to cheer on the Terrapins. There is even an entire student group, the UMD Crew, dedicated to supporting the soccer team. They host tailgates, gather in the stands and even mock opponents to cheer on Maryland.</p>
               <p>However, the Crew mostly supports the men’s team, just one example of how support for the men’s and women’s soccer teams is not equal at the university. The inequality in popularity for each team is further evidenced by the fact that men’s soccer home games have remarkably higher attendance than the women’s team.</p>
               <p>The University of Maryland Athletics Department provides statistics pertaining to game attendance for each of the university’s sports teams, which was used to analyze the contrasts in community support for the men’s and women’s soccer programs. </p>

            <p>To summarize: the data say that LeBron is Mr. Playoffs, and some of the most epic carry jobs were done by finals losers, who maybe just needed one more piece to the puzzle to win it all. But mostly, this is another perspective to add to these on-going debates.</p>

                    <p>Data for this story came from 538. The analysis only included players with 150+ minutes played. There are a lot of metrics out there, and they can all be great and terrible. Quantity matters in the playoffs, so a cumulative stat was chosen.</p>
